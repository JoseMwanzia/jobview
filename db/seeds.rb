# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# puts "ðŸŒ± Creating companies ..."
# 10.times do 
#     password = Faker::Internet.password(min_length: 8, max_length: 16, mix_case: true, special_characters: false)
#     Company.create([{ company_name: Faker::Company.name }, { email: Faker::Internet.email, }, {password: password}, {password_confirmation: password}])
# end
# puts "âœ… Created 10 companies âœ¨"

#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
